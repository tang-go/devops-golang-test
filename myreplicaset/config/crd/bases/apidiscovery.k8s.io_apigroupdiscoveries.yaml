                          For many clients the singular form of the resource will be more understandable to users reading messages and should be used when integrating the name of the resource into a sentence.
                          The command line tool kubectl, for example, allows use of the singular resource name in place of plurals.
                          The singular form of a resource should always be an optional element - when in doubt use the canonical resource name.

                          resource is the plural name of the resource.  This is used in the URL path and is the unique identifier
                          for this resource across all versions in the API group.
                          Resources with non-empty groups are located at /apis/<APIGroupDiscovery.objectMeta.name>/<APIVersionDiscovery.version>/<APIResourceDiscovery.Resource>
                          Resources with empty groups are located at /api/v1/<APIResourceDiscovery.Resource>

                          responseKind describes the group, version, and kind of the serialization schema for the object type this endpoint typically returns.
                          APIs may return other objects types at their discretion, such as error conditions, requests for alternate representations, or other operation specific behavior.
                          This value will be null or empty if an APIService reports subresources but supports no operations on the parent resource

                        description: |-
                          singularResource is the singular name of the resource.  This allows clients to handle plural and singular opaquely.
                          For many clients the singular form of the resource will be more understandable to users reading messages and should be used when integrating the name of the resource into a sentence.
                          The command line tool kubectl, for example, allows use of the singular resource name in place of plurals.
                          The singular form of a resource should always be an optional element - when in doubt use the canonical resource name.
