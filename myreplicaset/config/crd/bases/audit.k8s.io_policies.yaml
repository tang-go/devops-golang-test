              This is used as a global default - a value of 'true' will omit the managed fileds,
              otherwise the managed fields will be included in the API audit log.

                          - `*/scale` matches all scale subresources.


                          If wildcard is present, the validation rule will ensure resources do not
                          overlap with each other.
