          PodSchedulingContext objects hold information that is needed to schedule
          a Pod with ResourceClaims that use "WaitForFirstConsumer" allocation
          mode.


          This is an alpha type and requires enabling the DynamicResourceAllocation
          feature gate.

              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

                  The size of this field is limited to 128. This is large enough for

                  that suits all pending resources. This may get increased in the
                  future, but not reduced.
